# Background

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("backgroundSOBP.png")

```

- Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) MRI: widely used method to investigate **functional brain networks**. 

- While there has been extensive research on the organization of functional networks in adults, there has been **less focus** on organization of functional brain networks during childhood due to limited sample sizes. 

- Here, we describe a detailed view of functional brain network organization using RSFC data from the **largest developmental dataset to date** with high accuracy and precision. 

# Methods

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("methodsfinal.png")

```

<div align="center">This project used RSFC data released through the ABCD fast track portal.</div>

- **N = 7,303 youth ages 9-10 years** across the **discovery (N = 3,615)** and **replication (N = 3,688)** sets. 

- Functional networks for each dataset were identified by calculating the **Pearson correlation matrix of timecourses** from all cortical vertices, and averaging those matrices across participants.

- Each cortical vertex was then assigned to a functional network using an adaptive version of the **graph theoretical community detection algorithm Infomap**.

# Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%'}

```

*Figure 1*. **Highly reproducible group average correlation matrices across the discovery and replication datasets (r = 0.99)**.

```

*Figure 2*. **Highly reproducible functional architecture with a normalized mutual information (NMI) of 0.88.** 

Across the cortex, 9-10 yr olds demonstrated similar canonical functional networks that have been **well-characterized in adults**. </div>


# Conclusions
- We leveraged the largest available collection of RSFC in children to provide a **normative baseline representation of childhood functional brain network organization**. 

- This can serve as a **benchmark for comparison to be used in neurodevelopmental disorder studies**, as well as to understand developmental trajectories of functional brain organization. 

# Future Directions
- To delineate the relationship of functional organization, we can investigate this network representation across other structures such as the **subcortex and cerebellum** using previously defined approaches in the lab.

- Given that we now have **2 time points from ABCD**, we can compare the similarity between discovery at time point 1 and replication at time point 2.
