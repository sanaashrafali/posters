# Who we are

Academia has a long way to go in uplifting and promoting minorities and people of color, as the institutional barriers plague our educational system to this day. **Colors of the Brain** (CoB) is a UC San Diego student organization that was founded in 2016 to diversify STEM graduate education by providing undergraduate students from **historically underrepresented backgrounds with invested graduate student mentors** who have gone through the transition into Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D research programs. 

Our organization  aims to provide **direct mentorship** and resources to underrepresented minority students interested in STEM fields. All of our graduate mentors come from **underrepresented and/or first-generation backgrounds**, and we are all motivated by the desire to give other students advice and access to the things we struggled with ourselves.

Since 2020, CoB has collaborated with the Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind to create the **CoB-KIBM Scholars Program**, a paid, full-time Summer research position within a UC San Diego or Salk laboratory that offers personalized mentorship for navigating academic research.

# What we do

In CoB, we host **tailored workshops** and provide a **supportive environment** where undergraduate students can get assistance with reviewing and editing their resumes/CVs and applications for various academic opportunities, ranging from conference travel awards and research positions to graduate program applications. We also create a **social infrastructure and community** where students can find mentors, discuss projects, or just decompress about academic life.

# 2023 CoB-KIBM Scholars Summer Research Program

<div align="center"> *General Program Overview* </div>

**Cohort**: Six scholars will be selected based on demonstrated financial need and clearly articulated excitement for neuroscience research.

**Stipend**: Each scholar will be provided a $7,000 stipend for the entire 10-week research period.

**Faculty Mentors**: Each scholar will be paired with a Faculty Mentor for the duration of the 10-week research period. These Faculty Mentors will be pre-selected by the CoB graduate mentors to ensure they can provide a constructive and positive research environment.

**Mentorship Pods**: Each scholar will be paired with 3 Colors of the Brain Graduate Student Mentors. Graduate Mentors will span a variety of fields within the brain sciences and from different stages of their graduate careers. A budget of $100 is given to these mentorship pods to facilitate casual meet-ups for advising.

**Bootcamp**: Scholars will participate in an evening of neuroscience related activities in the first week of the program, which will include programming and histology tutorials. This will serve as a program orientation and an early opportunity to familiarize scholars with each other.

**Workshops**: Scholars will attend a series of workshops on scientific writing, research, and applying to graduate school.

- Examples: How to Read a Research Paper; Basic Computational Methods; How to Make a Scientific Research Poster; Applying to Paid Research Opportunities for Undergraduates; Careers in STEM Panel. 

**Community**: The program will provide social and community building events throughout the Summer. Scholars will continue to receive academic support and mentorship from Colors of the Brain throughout the remainder of their undergraduate education. 

**Science Communication**: Opportunities to practice science communication skills by presenting at the CoB-KIBM Scholars Program Summer Research Symposium.

**Retention**: Assistance will be given to KIBM-CoB scholars in their future applications for other individual research fellowships at UC San Diego. 

**Eligibility**: 

- Have at least a 2.5 GPA
- Have demonstrable interest in pursuing research as a career.
- Intend to apply to Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D. programs relevant to the brain sciences.
