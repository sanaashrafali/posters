# Who we are

Academia has a long way to go in uplifting and promoting minorities and people of color, as the institutional barriers plague our educational system to this day. **Colors of the Brain** (CoB) is a UC San Diego student organization that was founded in 2016 to diversify STEM graduate education by providing undergraduate students from **historically underrepresented backgrounds with invested graduate student mentors** who have gone through the transition into Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D research programs. 

Our organization  aims to provide **direct mentorship** and resources to underrepresented minority students interested in STEM fields. All of our graduate mentors come from **underrepresented and/or first-generation backgrounds**, and we are all motivated by the desire to give other students advice and access to the things we struggled with ourselves.

Since 2020, CoB has collaborated with the Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind to create the **CoB-KIBM Scholars Program**, a paid, full-time Summer research position within a UC San Diego or Salk laboratory that offers personalized mentorship for navigating academic research.

# What we do

In CoB, we host **tailored workshops** and provide a **supportive environment** where undergraduate students can get assistance with reviewing and editing their resumes/CVs and applications for various academic opportunities, ranging from conference travel awards and research positions to graduate program applications. We also create a **social infrastructure and community** where students can find mentors, discuss projects, or just decompress about academic life.

Our scholars presented on a diverse range of neuroscience fields. General research interests include cognitive, behavioral, cellular/molecular and developmental. 

**Quotes from 2021 cohort:**

"I think this was a wonderful program and exactly what I needed to kickstart me in the right direction for my future! Thank you so much for all your help"

"It is the best summer program I have ever attended."

In 2022, we were able to accept 6 scholars in our program! They were interested in topics such as X, Y and Z.

# Next Steps

Our organizations goal is to constantly be improving and evolving. We have expanded our **leadership roles** to include multiple people from varying disciplines (i.e., neuroscience, cognitive science and experimental psychology). We are also hoping to lock down additional funding for our summer program to ensure **successful research projects and appropriate living stipends**. We aim to have a broader impact and to reach diverse audiences throughout the UC San Diego community by promoting our organization at conferences, outreach, and social media.
